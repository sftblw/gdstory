TODO: fill description, make first working somewhat

intended to create visual novel engine? framework? player? via Godot Engine 2 and tries to compile to its gdscript and tries to utilize its editor fully

with incremental smaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaal development size (but It gets larger and larger to not to be finished oh my god)

Utilizing godot engine is good for game engines because...

- Cross-Platform including mobile area
- Awesome animation editor

Converting own script to gdscript comes with awesome advantage:

- compile-time compression of script?
- locking scripts to be edited and extracted?
- amuton tonikaku it's awesome because I say it's awesome. no other words please. It's royal order.
